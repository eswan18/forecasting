# Storybook Setup Summary

## Current Status

I've successfully set up Storybook 8.6 for your Next.js project with experimental support for React Server Components. Here's what has been configured:

### ✅ What's Been Set Up

1. **Updated Configuration** (`/.storybook/main.ts`)
   - Added experimental RSC support with `experimentalRSC: true`
   - Configured story paths to include components and app directories
   - Added proper Vite configuration for alias resolution
   - Added theme addon for light/dark mode support

2. **Enhanced Preview** (`/.storybook/preview.ts`)
   - Configured theme switching with `@storybook/addon-themes`
   - Added Next.js app directory support
   - Imported global styles

3. **Server Component Support**
   - Created `ServerComponentWrapper` for handling async components
   - Added utilities for mocking async data in stories

4. **Example Stories Created**
   - `Button.stories.tsx` - Comprehensive button component examples
   - `Card.stories.tsx` - Various card layouts and use cases
   - `Input.stories.tsx` - Form input variations and states
   - `ServerComponentExample.stories.tsx` - Patterns for handling server components

5. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive README in `.storybook/README.md`
   - Includes best practices and troubleshooting guide

## React Server Components Support

### Current State (2024/2025)

Storybook now has **experimental** support for React Server Components through the `@storybook/experimental-nextjs-vite` package. This means:

- ✅ **Client components work perfectly** - Any component with `"use client"` directive
- ✅ **Basic RSC rendering** - The framework can handle some server component scenarios
- ⚠️ **Async components need special handling** - Use the `ServerComponentWrapper`
- ❌ **Server actions don't work** - `"use server"` functions need to be mocked
- ❌ **Direct database calls won't work** - Need to mock data fetching

### Best Practices for Your Project

1. **Focus on Client Components First**
   - Most of your UI components are already client components
   - These provide the most value in Storybook for testing interactions

2. **Mock Server Data**
   - Pass data as props instead of fetching in the component
   - Use the patterns shown in `ServerComponentExample.stories.tsx`

3. **Use the Wrapper for Async Components**
   ```tsx
   <ServerComponentWrapper>
     <YourAsyncComponent />
   </ServerComponentWrapper>
   ```

## Running Storybook

```bash
# Start development server
npm run storybook

# Build static Storybook
npm run build-storybook
```

## Next Steps

1. **Create More Stories**
   - Add stories for your existing UI components
   - Focus on components in `/components/ui/`
   - Document component variations and edge cases

2. **Test Interactions**
   - Add interaction tests for forms and buttons
   - Use Storybook's play functions for complex scenarios

3. **Monitor RSC Support**
   - Storybook's RSC support is actively being improved
   - Check for updates that might enable more server component features

## Recommendations

Given the current state of RSC support in Storybook:

1. **It's worth using Storybook now** for:
   - UI component development
   - Design system documentation
   - Visual regression testing
   - Component interaction testing

2. **Limitations to be aware of**:
   - Server components need workarounds
   - Some Next.js features won't work
   - May need to refactor some components for better Storybook compatibility

3. **Future outlook**:
   - RSC support is improving rapidly
   - By late 2025, expect much better server component support
   - The investment in setting up Storybook now will pay off

The setup is ready to use, and while server components have limitations, the majority of your components will work great in Storybook!
