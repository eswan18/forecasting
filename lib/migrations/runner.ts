/**
 * The migration runner: applies `migrations/` to a database, and nothing else.
 *
 * This is the counterpart to the startup check in `./check`. The check refuses
 * to start an app whose database is not at the build's schema; *something* has
 * to be able to move a database to that schema, and in bifrost preview
 * environments that something is an initContainer running the app image.
 *
 * The runner stage carries neither `kysely-ctl` nor `tsx`, so `npm exec kysely
 * migrate up` — the way migrations are run by hand — cannot work there: the
 * `.ts` migration files have nothing to load them. Instead
 * `scripts/build-migration-runner.ts` compiles the migrations and this module
 * into a single self-contained `dist/migrate/index.js` at build time, which the
 * Dockerfile copies into the image. See that script and the README.
 *
 * What this module deliberately does NOT do: inspect the schema, infer state,
 * repair anything, or decide that a database "looks new". It hands a fixed set
 * of migrations to kysely's own `Migrator` and reports what happened. Every
 * decision about what to apply is kysely's.
