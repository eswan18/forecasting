/**
 * A fail-closed startup check that the database schema matches the migrations
 * this build was compiled with.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT apply migrations. The goal is to refuse to start —
 * with a clear, actionable error — when code is deployed against a database
 * that hasn't been migrated, rather than silently serving against a schema the
 * code doesn't expect and failing much later, at runtime, on whichever query
 * first touches a missing column. Applying migrations stays a separate,
 * deliberate act (`npm exec kysely migrate up`).
 *
 * The motivating case is bifrost preview environments: a preview gets its own
 * Neon database branch cut from staging's schema, so a branch that adds a
 * migration produces a preview whose schema is behind its code.
 *
 * A database that is *ahead* of the code is rejected too — an old image rolled
 * back onto a newer schema is just as wrong, and just as worth catching.
 *
 * The list of expected migrations comes from `./manifest`, a generated source
 * file, because the runtime image has no `migrations/` directory to read: the
 * Dockerfile's runner stage copies only `.next/standalone` and `.next/static`.

 * `DEFAULT_MIGRATION_TABLE = 'kysely_migration'`. The integration test asserts
 * this name against a real migrated database so a kysely upgrade that changed
