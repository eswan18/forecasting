/**
 * The directory the users page is set as.
 *
 * It lives beside neither the page nor the entry because both need it: the page
 * injects it, and an entry is only set correctly inside it (the two gutters its
 * photo and its menu sit in), so a story for an entry has to be able to inject
 * it too.
 *
 * Two columns rather than one, because the page is a list of names and an
 * address each, and a name is nothing like 58rem wide. Set in one column, every
 * entry left a hand's width of blank paper between the address and the menu
 * that acts on it, and twenty-six accounts ran off the bottom of the screen.
 *
 * Module-level constant, no interpolation: this is a stylesheet, not content.
